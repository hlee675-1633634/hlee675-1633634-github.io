	<p><font face="comic sans ms" color="white">This is the Comic Sans MS font. It was designed by Vincent Connare and released in 1994 by Microsoft. This is a more casual font, and it is intended for informal documents and children's materials. </font><p/>

	<p><font face="helvetica" color="white">This is the Helvetica font. It was developed in 1957 by Max Miedinger with input from Eduard Hoffmann. The two wanted to create a neutral typeface that had great clarity and no intrinsic meaning. It was originally named New Haas Grotesque, but renamed Helvetica.</font><p/>
